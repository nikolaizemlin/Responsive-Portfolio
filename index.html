            <img src="assets/images/nick.jpg" alt="Profile Picture" style="width:200px; height=200px; margin-right:15px" />I worked as a mechanic though high school and for a few years
            after I graduated. I opened a mechanic shop with my dad and worked with him for about 4 years.  I left and went into steel construction and worked on
            commercial building and hung drywall for about 4 years. I then went on to build a few houses in the valley and did some TI work in some commercial building.
            Took a month and helped build a log cabin in Utah. I got tired of working out in the sun, so I went and got a degree and started working at Shasta Pools.
            Soon I was drawing all the pools for Mesa, Tempe, Ahwatukee, Chandler, Gilbert, San Tan valley, Tucson and Florence. I received a job offer at Titan for detailing
            formwork drawings and took it. I have been with Titan for 14 years now and enjoy working for this company. I have done AutoCAD drawings and some Engineering for this
            company. I have also largely developed the R&D department. I had Titan purchase a 3D printer and Solid works even did some testing of equipment out in the field. I
            have helped develop a CRM program over the last two years and feel coding and programing will be a good fit for me. I also do IT stuff for Titan. I am really looking
            forward to this next chapter.
